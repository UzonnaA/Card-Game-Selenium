The frontend is sloppy, I know.

Basically, you use submit to submit a number as input and enter to get to the next page.
After you submit something, wait to see if text shows up. If not, you probably have to hit enter

However, there's sometimes garbage text that shows up, so after hitting submit, hit enter to read any new text and eventually it will make sense
